# Information
1943 arcade core ported from [jotego](https://github.com/jotego/jtcores.git)

Core Id: jt1943

# How to run
Needs the 1943.rom and a proper ARC file in the core or SD root folder
You need to either update/rename the core file to jt1943.rbf or change its reference in the ARC file accordingly

# Known issues
The game is vertical and so far there is no support for rotation on calypso. So you would need a monitor or a room with rotation support ;-)

# Changelog
- 0.1. First release.
